# Energy Consumption Descriptive Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing descriptive analysis on energy consumption data
to understand usage behavior, trends, and key statistical patterns. The analysis
is carried out using Python and real-world Excel datasets to extract meaningful
insights through data cleaning, statistical summaries, and visual exploration.

## Objectives
- Analyze energy consumption datasets using descriptive statistics
- Identify trends and patterns in energy usage
- Clean and preprocess raw data for analysis
- Visualize energy consumption insights for better understanding

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Microsoft Excel

## Dataset Description
The project uses multiple Excel (.xls) files containing structured energy
consumption data. These datasets are combined and analyzed to study energy usage
patterns and variations.

## Analysis Workflow
- Importing and inspecting datasets
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Performing descriptive statistical analysis
- Creating visualizations for insights
- Interpreting results and observations

## Key Insights
- Identified consumption trends across datasets
- Observed variations in energy usage patterns
- Summarized data using descriptive statistics
- Visualized energy consumption behavior using charts and graphs

## Repository Structure
- `energy_consumption_descriptive_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis
- `data1.xls` – Energy consumption dataset
- `data2.xls` – Energy consumption dataset
- `data3.xls` – Energy consumption dataset

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in Jupyter Notebook
3. Ensure required Python libraries are installed
4. Execute the notebook cells step by step

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of descriptive data analysis techniques
to real-world energy consumption data. The insights generated can support better
understanding of energy usage behavior and data-driven decision-making.
